Vuejs Image Gallery

My first attempt at creating a reactive image gallery/viewer with vuejs. Currently utilizing Vue.js 4.1.1.

This project is based on the following node modules(node 10.15.0):
- Axios http req.
- Stack-grid images (vue).

To run the project follow the instructions below:

## Vuejs Project setup
Download, extract zip file from &quot;Releases&quot;.

Start up server in project directory by running
```
npm run serve
```
Open localhost at index.html.

### To Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
